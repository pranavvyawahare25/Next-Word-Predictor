# Next-Word-Predictor with Python  Project Link : https://next-word-predicto.streamlit.app/
This Python project aims to develop a next word predictor based on a given input sentence. The predictor analyzes the input text and suggests the most probable word that could follow it, utilizing techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

# Dataset
In this project, we've used a dataset called the "tropical_chat.csv" for Next Word Prediction." The dataset contains a collection of conversational messages covering a wide range of topics, including technology, animals, and hobbies.
Each message is associated with its context and may contain discussions about Google, Microsoft, fish, cats, dance, and various other subjects.
Messages are provided in a structured format, enabling easy ingestion for training and evaluation purposes.

# Prerequisites
o Python 3.x

o Required libraries: nltk, numpy, scikit-learn,TensorFlow library



o Install the required dependencies using pip install tensorflow.
# Getting Started
o Clone the repository:

git clone: 
https://github.com/pranavvyawahare25/Next-Word-Predictor

o Navigate to the project directory:

cd Next-Word-Predictor

# Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine.

# Data
The project may require additional data for training the predictive model. 

Commonly used datasets for NLP tasks include the Gutenberg corpus, Brown corpus, or custom datasets specific to the application domain.

# Model
The predictor may utilize different models for word prediction, including:

1. n-gram models
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
3. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
4. Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, BERT)
