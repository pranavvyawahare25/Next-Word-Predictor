# Next-Word-Predictor with Python
This Python project aims to develop a next word predictor based on a given input sentence. The predictor analyzes the input text and suggests the most probable word that could follow it, utilizing techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

# Dataset
In this project, we've used a dataset called the "Project Gutenberg Book Corpus for Next Word 
Prediction." We created this dataset ourselves by gathering lots of books from Project 
Gutenberg, a website with free books. Each book in our dataset is kept together, and we also 
included details like the book's title, author, and when it was published. Our dataset has various
kinds of books, from different times and genres, like novels, poems, and more. We picked these 
books to make sure we have a wide variety of writing styles and topics.
In our Next Word Prediction project, we're using our dataset as the starting point to teach 
machine learning models how to guess the next word in a sentence. We're taking advantage of 
how language follows a sequence - one word comes after another. We're using techniques like 
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to help us analyse the patterns in the words. 
We feed our dataset into these models, letting them learn from the thousands of words they see. 
As they learn, it will start to understand how words are used together and what word might 
come next based on what came before. It's like when you read a sentence and can guess what 
the next word might be because of the words you've already read.
Once our models are trained with our dataset, they get really good at guessing the next word in 
a sentence. They will learn the patterns and connections between words, so it can make smart 
guesses about what word should come next based on the words it have seen before. Our goal 
is to make a model that can predict the next word accurately and quickly, making it easier for 
people to write and understand text in various applications.

# Data
The project may require additional data for training the predictive model. 

Commonly used datasets for NLP tasks include the Gutenberg corpus, Brown corpus, or custom datasets specific to the application domain.

# Model
The predictor may utilize different models for word prediction, including:

1. n-gram models
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
3. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
4. Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, BERT)
