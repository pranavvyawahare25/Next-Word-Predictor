# Next-Word-Predictor with Python
This Python project aims to develop a next word predictor based on a given input sentence. The predictor analyzes the input text and suggests the most probable word that could follow it, utilizing techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

# Dataset
In this project, we've used a dataset called the "Project Gutenberg Book Corpus for Next Word 
Prediction." dataset has various kinds of books, from different times and genres, like novels, poems, and more. 
In Next Word Prediction project, we're using the dataset as the starting point to teach 
machine learning models how to guess the next word in a sentence. 
It's like when you read a sentence and can guess what 
the next word might be because of the words you've already read.
Our goal is to make a model that can predict the next word accurately and quickly, making it easier for 
people to write and understand text in various applications.

# Prerequisites
o Python 3.x

o Required libraries: nltk, numpy, scikit-learn,TensorFlow library



o Install the required dependencies using pip install tensorflow.
# Getting Started
o Clone the repository:

git clone: 
https://github.com/pranavvyawahare25/Next-Word-Predictor

o Navigate to the project directory:

cd Next-Word-Predictor

# Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine.

# Data
The project may require additional data for training the predictive model. 

Commonly used datasets for NLP tasks include the Gutenberg corpus, Brown corpus, or custom datasets specific to the application domain.

# Model
The predictor may utilize different models for word prediction, including:

1. n-gram models
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
3. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
4. Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, BERT)
